# Html-CSS-project-3 simplified flexbox+responsive 

## Description:
This project is the simplest thing I did, surely you wonder why?. What I would like to leave captured, is the simplicity with which I can work and reach totally optimal results. Sometimes we work and add a lot of tools that only complicate the work, thinking so, that more complex is better. This is the great example that the answer is "NO". Here we see a simple code, using only the "flex" variant, no colors, no images.
I just want to make it clear, that with a few code lines you can do truly functional things. As a result you're not only going to help yourself, but also your teammates.
